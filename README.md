# python_jq
A simple Python CLI JSON parser

As the name suggests this should end up being similar to the very popular [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) tool

## End goal
Create a tool that can be called from a terminal to parse a JSON file into a "pretty format" from a string of data (i.e. a file being read) or used as an input from another CLI tool.

### Outputting
Ideally have the options to just print the output but also save it as another file or send it elsewhere as well as providing options for manipulating and retrieving items from the data.
